## Implementation Details

### Backend Architecture
- **Payment Service**: Encapsulates Lenco API calls (mobile money, card, verification)
- **Payment Routes**: RESTful endpoints for payment operations
- **Database Schema**: Tracks all payment transactions with status
- **Payment Verification**: Server-side verification before CV creation
- **Webhook Support**: Handles real-time payment status updates from Lenco

### Frontend Architecture
- **PaymentDialog Component**: 
  - Mobile Money option (primary) with phone number input
  - Card Payment option (secondary)
  - Visual selection indicators
  - Loading states
- **Payment Flow Integration**: Seamlessly integrated into CV creation
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages
- **API Client**: Type-safe payment methods

### Payment Flow
1. User creates first CV → Free (no payment)
2. User creates additional CV → Payment dialog appears
3. User selects payment method:
   - Mobile Money: Enters phone number
   - Card: Proceeds to card payment
4. Payment initiated with Lenco API
5. User completes payment on Lenco's page
6. Payment verified via webhook or manual check
7. CV created upon successful payment
8. User redirected to dashboard

## Technical Features

✅ **Mobile Money First**: Primary payment option with phone input  
✅ **Card Payment Second**: Alternative payment option  
✅ **Lenco API v2.0**: Full integration with official API  
✅ **Payment Tracking**: Database records all transactions  
✅ **Secure Verification**: Server-side payment validation  
✅ **Webhook Support**: Real-time payment updates  
✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management  
✅ **TypeScript**: Fully typed implementation  
✅ **Responsive UI**: Mobile-friendly payment dialog  
✅ **Documentation**: Complete integration guide  

## Database Migration
```sql
CREATE TABLE payments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  cv_id UUID,
  amount INTEGER NOT NULL,
  currency TEXT DEFAULT 'USD',
  payment_method TEXT NOT NULL,
  lenco_reference TEXT UNIQUE,
  status TEXT NOT NULL,
  metadata JSON,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Environment Variables Required
```env
LENCO_API_KEY=your-lenco-api-key
LENCO_SECRET_KEY=your-lenco-secret-key
LENCO_BASE_URL=https://api.lenco.co/v2
```

## API Endpoints Added
- `POST /payment/initiate` - Initialize payment
- `POST /payment/verify/:reference` - Verify payment
- `POST /payment/webhook` - Handle Lenco callbacks

## Build Status
✅ Backend: Compiles successfully (TypeScript)  
✅ Frontend: Builds successfully (Vite)  
✅ No linting errors  
✅ Type-safe implementation  

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test mobile money payment with sandbox phone numbers
2. Test card payment with sandbox card numbers
3. Test payment verification flow
4. Test webhook handling
5. Test error scenarios (declined payment, network errors)

## Security Considerations
- API keys stored in environment variables
- Payment verification on server-side only
- Unique payment references to prevent duplicates
- Status validation before CV creation
- Webhook signature verification (recommended for production)

## Next Steps for Production
1. Sign up for Lenco account
2. Obtain production API credentials
3. Configure environment variables
4. Run database migration
5. Test with sandbox first
6. Deploy with production credentials
7. Monitor webhook logs
8. Set up payment monitoring/alerts

## Documentation
- Main README updated with Lenco integration details
- LENCO_INTEGRATION.md provides comprehensive guide
- Code comments explain key functionality
- Screenshot demonstrates UI implementation

## Compliance
✅ Meets requirement: Mobile money as first option  
✅ Meets requirement: Card as second option  
✅ Meets requirement: Lenco API integration (https://lenco-api.readme.io/v2.0)  
✅ Minimal changes to existing codebase  
✅ Maintains backward compatibility (first CV still free)

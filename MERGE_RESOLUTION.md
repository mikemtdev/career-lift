# Merge Resolution Summary

## Issue Resolved
GitHub user @mikemtdev requested to "resolve conflicts" on the PR.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Identified Conflicts
Found merge conflicts in 3 files after GitHub's auto-merge of main branch:
- `backend/src/routes/cv.ts`
- `frontend/src/App.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`

### 2. GitHub Auto-Merge Analysis
GitHub had already attempted an auto-merge (commit 3eff208) which:
- ✅ Correctly merged `backend/src/routes/cv.ts` (included both `price` and `cvCount`)
- ❌ Missed the `/admin` route in `frontend/src/App.tsx`
- ✅ Correctly merged `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` (both Edit and Shield icons)

### 3. Manual Resolution
- Reset local branch to GitHub's auto-merge commit
- Added missing `/admin` route to `App.tsx`
- Verified all builds pass successfully
- Committed and pushed the fix

## Final State

### Routes Configured
```typescript
// frontend/src/App.tsx
<Route path="/login" element={<Login />} />
<Route path="/signup" element={<Signup />} />
<Route path="/dashboard" element={<Dashboard />} />
<Route path="/create-cv" element={<CreateCV />} />
<Route path="/admin" element={<AdminDashboard />} />      // ✅ Fixed
<Route path="/edit-cv/:id" element={<EditCV />} />        // ✅ From main
<Route path="/" element={<Navigate to="/dashboard" />} />
```

### Backend Payment Response
```typescript
// backend/src/routes/cv.ts
return res.status(402).json({
  error: 'Payment required',
  message: `Additional CVs cost $${priceInDollars}. Please confirm payment.`,
  requiresPayment: true,
  price: priceInCents,     // ✅ From admin branch
  cvCount: userCvs.length, // ✅ From main branch
});
```

### Dashboard Icons
```typescript
// frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx
import { Download, Plus, FileText, Shield, Edit } from 'lucide-react';
// ✅ Both Shield (admin) and Edit icons imported and used
```

## Verification

✅ Backend builds successfully
✅ Frontend builds successfully  
✅ TypeScript compilation passes
✅ All routes functional
✅ No conflicts remaining
✅ Changes pushed to PR
